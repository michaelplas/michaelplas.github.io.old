# Why You Should Always Use 2FA

Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a security feature that requires two forms of identification in order to access an account. This can include a password and a fingerprint, a password and a code sent to your phone, or a password and a security key.

Using 2FA can greatly improve the security of your accounts. Even if someone has your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second form of identification. This can help protect your sensitive information, such as your email, bank account, or social media profiles.

Many popular websites and services now offer 2FA as an option, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more. It's important to take advantage of this feature whenever possible to help keep your accounts secure.

So next time you're setting up a new account, be sure to enable 2FA if it's available. It could make all the difference in protecting your online identity and data.
