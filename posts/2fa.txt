Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a security measure that requires you to provide two forms of identification in order to access your account. This is usually something you know, such as a password, and something you have, such as a security token or your phone.

Using 2FA provides an extra layer of security to your accounts, making it much more difficult for hackers to gain access to your sensitive information. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won't be able to log in without also having access to your phone or security token.

Many websites and apps now offer 2FA as an option, and it's important to take advantage of this extra layer of security. It may take a little extra time to set up, but the peace of mind knowing your accounts are more secure is well worth it.

So, next time you're setting up a new account or updating your security settings, be sure to turn on 2FA!
