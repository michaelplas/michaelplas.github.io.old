# Why You Should Always Use 2FA

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts. It requires you to provide two forms of identification before you can access your account, typically a password and a code sent to your phone or email.

Using 2FA can help prevent unauthorized access to your accounts, even if someone manages to steal your password. It's a simple but effective way to improve your online security and protect your personal information.

Here are some reasons why you should always use 2FA:

1. Protects Against Password Theft
2. Provides an Extra Layer of Security
3. Easy to Set Up and Use

So, always remember to enable 2FA whenever possible to stay secure online!
