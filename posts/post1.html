  <h1>Why You Should Use 2FA</h1>
  <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires two forms of identification to access an account. Typically, this involves something you know (like a password) and something you have (like a smartphone or hardware token).</p>
  <p>Here are some reasons why you should use 2FA:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Increased security:</strong> 2FA adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won't be able to access your account without also having access to your smartphone or hardware token.</li>
    <li><strong>Protection against phishing:</strong> Phishing attacks are a common way that hackers steal passwords. However, with 2FA, even if you fall for a phishing scam and enter your password on a fake website, the attacker still won't be able to access your account without the second form of identification.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance with regulations:</strong> Many organizations and industries require the use of 2FA to comply with regulations or security best practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> Using 2FA can give you peace of mind knowing that your online accounts are more secure.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Overall, 2FA is a simple and effective way to add an extra layer of security to your online accounts. It's easy to set up and can greatly reduce the risk of your accounts being compromised.</p>
