      <h1>Why You Should Use Two-Factor Authentication</h1>
      <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires users to provide two forms of authentication before they can access an account. This typically involves a password and a unique code that is generated by an app or sent via SMS.</p>
      <p>There are several reasons why you should use 2FA:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved security:</strong> 2FA provides an additional layer of security beyond just a password, making it harder for attackers to gain access to your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Protection against phishing:</strong> Many phishing attacks involve tricking users into providing their login credentials. 2FA can help protect against these types of attacks by requiring a second form of authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Many organizations are required by law or regulation to use 2FA for certain types of accounts or data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Overall, using 2FA is a simple and effective way to improve the security of your accounts.</p>
